#TODO 
Simple todo list for my config file. 

- Break config into 'modules' to loaded by the main config file. (Have started doing this) 
- On 'fresh install' of emacs have emacs auto-install all the needed packages. 
Might wait until emacs25 so as to not install old packages from the gnu source instead of the melpa source
- Get better auto-complete functionality for C-mode
- Intergrate org-mode more into my workflow 
- More to come soon.
